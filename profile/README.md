Flowr is my proof-of-concept showcasing a solution to large music platforms' mistreatment of smaller, independent music artists. More specifically, I implemented data, payment, and ownership transparency within Flowr's architecture through blockchain. Artists, labels, and all participating parties alike can rest assured that their work is valued and they are compensated as they expect. 
Ultimately, this project was discontinued as I realized it did not provide much business value. When talking to various independent artists, it became clear their main revenue / livelihood comes live performances and services, not music streaming or distribution. Thus, the idea of a music-streaming platform supporting independent artists is slightly paradoxical. Until I find another way to impact the music industry for the better through my engineering, here is a demo of what I built! [demo link](INSERT)
